# 🎵 Bansuri Pro Studio
**A Cyber-Acoustic Journey into Meditative Sound**

Bansuri Pro Studio is a web-based musical instrument that explores the intersection of digital precision and acoustic soul. By combining the ancient philosophy of the Indian bamboo flute with modern Web Audio synthesis, this project aims to produce not just sound—but calm.

## 🌟 Vision
> "The goal was not accuracy alone, but peace, breath, and flow."

This project is an experiment in **cyber-acoustics**. It was built to explore how procedural audio can recreate the spiritual essence of traditional instruments while maintaining a futuristic, high-fidelity digital aesthetic.

## 🛠 Technical Blueprint

The audio engine is built entirely with the **Web Audio API**, using mathematical synthesis rather than static samples to ensure every note feels alive.

* **Additive Synthesis:** Layers three distinct sine waves to recreate the unique "hollow" harmonic resonance of a real bamboo flute.
* **Portamento Glide:** Implements a 100ms frequency transition (linear ramp) to simulate the fluid movement of air within a physical pipe.
* **Custom Reverb:** Uses a convolution engine with a generated impulse response to place the sound in a virtual 2.5-second hall.
* **Dynamic Visuals:** A real-time aura visualizer built on the **Canvas API**, mapped to the frequency data of the master output.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Initialize:** Click the "Initialize Engine" button to start the AudioContext.
2.  **Breathe:** Hold the **SPACEBAR** to blow air into the instrument.
3.  **Notes:** Use keys **Q, W, E, R, T, Y** to cover and uncover the flute holes.
4.  **Flow:** Experiment with releasing keys while holding space to hear the portamento glide.

## 🎨 Design Aesthetic
The UI features a **"Goated" Glassmorphic** design:
* **Materials:** Dark wood gradients with gold accents.
* **Atmosphere:** Deep space backgrounds with glowing cyan active states.
* **Heritage:** An iridescent peacock feather (Mayur Pankh) as a nod to the cultural roots of the instrument.
